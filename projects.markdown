Here are some of the things I did, some places I've been to, and some responsibilities I've had in the past and in the present time. I've put them here for you to poke around, play with, inspire, fork, make fun of, learn, or maybe just for you to exercise your nosiness. Just don't blow up the country with anything here (I'm looking at you old friend. Not that it's feasible at all, even in the faintest sense).

Some of these aren't even projects, because I've included interesting events that I've attended. Maybe you'll spot an event below and say "Hey, I've been there too!", or perhaps "Hey, maybe I should try this while I still can".
