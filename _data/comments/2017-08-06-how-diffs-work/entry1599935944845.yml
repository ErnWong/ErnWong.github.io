message: "Just been looking at how analog differential analysers work and wondered how differentials could be used as adding machines. This site is a bit long winded, but it did give the answer - well done. The 'linear' adders are a nice twist, and perhaps you should have started with those as they are conceptually easier to understand.\r\nOf course, with one more gear half the diameter of C linked to C, and another gear the same diameter linked to that gear, we could get a true C = A + B adding machine."
