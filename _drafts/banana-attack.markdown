I mean, I've "programmed" before 2010, before this nightmarish Flash platform game was born seven years ago. However, I consider this a big milestone for me because I saw programming in a different way.

Even the horrific mutated banana fusion monster graphics says so:

{% include image.html filename="banana-attack.gif" caption="'Banana Attack' I called it, for some reason" title="I've finally found a situation where GIF compression improves image quality. Yes, it has gone that bad" alt="The 'Banana Attack' gameplay screenshot" width="500" %}

Oh, ouch, my eyes... I never knew I was capable of dealing such damage to myself so many years on.

## Inspiration, and the development of my interests

It all began with these TV shows.

{% include image.html filename="memorable-tv-shows.jpg" caption="No cheese, Gromit!" title="Gosh, I even used the Bob the Builder Sistema lunchboxes for eight years" alt="The Bob the Builder TV show, and Wallace and Gromit films" %}

And maybe because of this, I started to like the idea of fixing things, and making things work.
