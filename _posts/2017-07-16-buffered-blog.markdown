## The Problem

I'm having a bit of difficulty keeping up with this blog...

{% include inline-svg.html filename="reflection.svg" caption="**Figure.** Artist's impression of my semester." %}

I don't want another zoombie website.

## Proposed Solution 1

{% include inline-svg.html filename="idea1.svg" caption="**Figure.** Boxes and lines drawn to connote a sense of quality to this article." %}

### Plus

- No longer do I need to stress about writing stuff during the semester while I study for university.

- I get continuous reward stimuli at times of need (especially in the midst of assignment deadlines and exams)

- I can act like a time management ninja.

  > "Whoa, you're prepping for exams *and* blogging a new post every week?"

### Minus

- Posts are not fresh.

## Proposed Solution 2

{% include inline-svg.html filename="idea2.svg" caption="**Figure.** Additional collection of boxes and lines to further solidify the point." %}

### Plus

- Perfect opportunity to confuse and prank everyone.

  > "You haven't written for months."
  >
  > "What do you mean? :)"
  >
  > "Wait what, these posts say they're from last month, but they weren't there before!"
  >
  > "It must be your browser cache."


### Minus

- Risk of losing all friends.

Wait, [what friends](http://i.imgur.com/0DpIA3o.gif).
