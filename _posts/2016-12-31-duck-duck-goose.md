## Setup

In this game, designate one person as *It*. Everyone else sits in a circle.

## Phase 1

*It* moves around the circle, tapping each person on the head.
At the same time, *It* calls "duck" out loud.

At some point, *It* may decide to say "goose" instead, upon tapping a particular person's head. If so, let the person tapped be the *Goose*, and *Phase 2* begins.

## Phase 2

*It*'s objective is to run one full circle and sit at the *Goose*'s location before *Goose* tags *It*, and vice versa.

If *It* suceeds, *Goose* becomes the new *It*. Else, *It* tries again.
Whichever is the case, *Phase 2* ends and *Phase 1* restarts.

## The Appendum ##

Imagine being the naturally slowest kid. If you become *It*, you can't pass on your role to someone else as the *Goose* will always catch you first. You'll be stuck, and the game will degenerate into mere organised shaming.

Thus, a feature called *The Dirty Duck Pond* was invented. When *Goose* catches *It*, the *Goose* will become the new *It* and the old *It* sits in the circle in the centre known as *The Dirty Duck Pond*. This old *It* sits in there until the next *It* gets caught and replaces the one in the pond.

As you can see in this New Zealand variant of the game, no one gets stuck.

*The seemingly bad prevents the worse.*

...and this blog is better than it looks.
